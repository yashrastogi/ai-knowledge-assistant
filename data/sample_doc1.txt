# Sample Knowledge Base Document

## Introduction to RAG Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge retrieval. This approach allows AI systems to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually relevant responses.

## Key Components

### 1. Document Store
The document store contains the knowledge base, which can include:
- PDF documents
- Text files
- CSV data
- Word documents
- Web pages

### 2. Embeddings
Embeddings convert text into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning. Popular embedding models include:
- OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small
- Sentence Transformers
- Cohere embeddings

### 3. Vector Database
Vector databases store and efficiently retrieve embeddings. Common options:
- FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Chroma

### 4. Retrieval
The retrieval process involves:
1. Converting user queries to embeddings
2. Searching the vector database for similar documents
3. Ranking and selecting the most relevant results

### 5. Generation
The LLM generates responses based on:
- The user's query
- Retrieved context from the knowledge base
- System instructions and constraints

## Best Practices

1. **Chunk Size**: Keep document chunks between 500-1000 tokens
2. **Overlap**: Use 10-20% overlap between chunks
3. **Metadata**: Include source, date, and type information
4. **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic and keyword search
5. **Reranking**: Use cross-encoders for better results

## Multi-Agent Workflows

Advanced RAG systems can use multiple specialized agents:
- **Retriever Agent**: Finds relevant documents
- **Synthesizer Agent**: Combines information from multiple sources
- **Validator Agent**: Checks answer accuracy and relevance
- **Router Agent**: Determines which agent should handle a task
